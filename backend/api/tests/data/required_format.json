More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).\n\n\n For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.\n Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.\n While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.\n\n\nGiven an array of integers `nums`, *find the next permutation of* `nums`.\n\n\nThe replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n",

Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n\nThe next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\n\n `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.\n `isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n\n\n\n```\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\n```\n\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\n\n1. If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\n2.

Specifically:\n\n\n\t+ If a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.\n\t+ If a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.\n **Omitting Empty Parentheses**: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., `()`) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.\n\n\nIn summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n",

Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n (An integer could be positive or negative.)\n A let expression takes the form `\"(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)\"`, where let is always the string `\"let\"`, then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable `v1` is assigned the value of the expression `e1`, the second variable `v2` is assigned the value of the expression `e2`, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression `expr`.\n An add expression takes the form `\"(add e1 e2)\"` where add is always the string `\"add\"`, there are always two expressions `e1`, `e2` and the result is the addition of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.\n A mult expression takes the form `\"(mult e1 e2)\"` where mult is always the string `\"mult\"`, there are always two expressions `e1`, `e2` and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names `\"add\"`, `\"let\"`, and `\"mult\"` are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n Finally, there is the concept of scope.

Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.\n\n\nFor example, we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add `80` and `45` into it. The Skiplist works this way:\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/27/1506_skiplist.gif)  \n\nArtyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skip_list_add_element-en.gif \"Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\")\n\n\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than `O(n)`. It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is `O(log(n))` and space complexity is `O(n)`.\n\n\nSee more about Skiplist: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list>\n\n\nImplement the `Skiplist` class:\n\n\n `Skiplist()` Initializes the object of the skiplist.\n `bool search(int target)` Returns `true` if the integer `target` exists in the Skiplist or `false` otherwise.\n `void add(int num)` Inserts the value `num` into the SkipList.\n `bool erase(int num)` Removes the value `num` from the Skiplist and returns `true`. If `num` does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return `false`. If there exist multiple `num` values, removing any one of them is fine.\n\n\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n",

You can perform the following operation repeatedly on the number `x`:\n\n\nIf `0 <= x <= 1000`, then for any index `i` in the array (`0 <= i < nums.length`), you can set `x` to any of the following:\n\n\n `x + nums[i]`\n `x - nums[i]`\n `x ^ nums[i]` (bitwise-XOR)\n\n\nNote that you can use each `nums[i]` any number of times in any order. Operations that set `x` to be out of the range `0 <= x <= 1000` are valid, but no more operations can be done afterward.\n\n\nReturn *the **minimum** number of operations needed to convert* `x = start` *into* `goal`*, and* `-1` *if it is not possible*.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n",
